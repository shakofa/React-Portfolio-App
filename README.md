# Description
A student portfolio is a compilation of academic work and other forms of educational evidence assembled for the purpose of evaluating coursework quality, learning progress, and academic achievement. In this project I used React to build a Responsive portfolio website. It includes:

* A short biography
* A contact form
* Images and deployed links of the projects
